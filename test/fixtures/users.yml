# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  email: testuser1@example.com
  encrypted_password: <%= Devise::Encryptor.digest(User, 'password123') %>
  # Add other fields as needed (e.g., name, created_at, updated_at)

two:
  email: testuser2@example.com
  encrypted_password: <%= Devise::Encryptor.digest(User, 'password123') %>
